LigthingIO is a 'light' network IO application framework;

NOTE
---

  This library still in progress, do not use it in your project or production environments;
  **email** me if any question and problem;

Learning and integrate what i think into LightingIO

LightingIO itself just a normal network application framework; all its technology from my practice and work

at the start time of this project; i use libevent, but i find many things was limited by the exsiting code; it's hard to hack or change
the libevent code; so... I give up libvent at last, and then start all things from zero, in thoes days and night, thanks the support from
my girl friends; and other reference books
